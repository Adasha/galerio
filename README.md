# GALERIO

Galerio is a Wordpress extension that adds content types, templates and blocks to suit an art gallery or other place that presents works. Galerio is simply 'Gallery' in Esperanto, as it is meant to be accessible to everyone.

Galerio uses the Pods framework for its underlying data structures, with a child theme providing the templates, and several 3rd-party plugins filling in for intended features. Ultimately, the plan is to encapsulate all the functionality within a plugin, but for now you'll need to follow a list to get it going on your site. It is in a pre-alpha state, so everything is subject to change.

Galerio has a demo/dev blog web site at https://galerio.net, but it's also in a very unfinished state. If you'd like to see Galerio in action on a real site, you can visit https://swansea.art.
